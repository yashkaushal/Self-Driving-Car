// This script is meant to help set up controllable cars.
// What it does is to detect situations where the car is fishtailing, and in that case, remove grip 
// from the front wheels. This will cause the car to slip more in the front then in the rear,
// thus recovering from the oversteer.

// This is not quite physically realitic, and may cause the gameplay to feel somewhat more acrade
// like, but is similar to how ESP systems work in real life
// (those will just apply the brakes to remove grip from wheels).
